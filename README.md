# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

Working through the exercises.

## Notes

### Stack

#### LIFO structure
- "last in first out" structure

#### Where used:
- manage function invocations
- undo /redo
- routing (the history object in browser)

#### Big O of Stacks
Insertion = O(1)
Removal - O(1)
Searching - O(N)

Should not use a Stack if you care about Searching and Access.

### Queues

- first in first out

#### Where used:
- background tasks
- upload resources
- print / task processing

#### Big O of Queues
Insertion - O(1)
Removal - O(1)
Searching - O(N)
Access - O(N)
